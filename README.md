# CodSoft

> A small collection of beginner Java programs (ATM simulation, Grade calculator, Number guessing game) â€” neat, educational, and perfect for practice and demos.


## About
CodSoft is a compact repository of simple Java console programs intended for learning core Java constructs: control flow, I/O, basics of OOP (where applicable), and simple algorithms. These are ideal as practice problems, classroom demos, or portfolio pieces for beginners.

> **Note:** The file descriptions below are inferred from filenames in the repository (`ATM.java`, `Grade.java`, `Guess.java`). If you copy this in, please replace any placeholder text with more precise descriptions or sample outputs from your implementations.

## Files
- `ATM.java`  
  A console-based ATM simulation. Typical responsibilities:
  - Authenticate user (if implemented)
  - Show menu (check balance, withdraw, deposit, exit)
  - Handle simple balance updates, input validation and error messages  
  **Placeholder:** Replace this line with one or two sentences describing how your `ATM` class works, what classes/methods it contains, and sample inputs/outputs.

- `Grade.java`  
  Computes grades or GPA from user input. Typical responsibilities:
  - Accept marks/score input
  - Calculate percentage/grade letter
  - Print grade and any remarks  
  **Placeholder:** Replace this line with details about grading scale, inputs accepted, and examples.

- `Guess.java`  
  A number-guessing game. Typical responsibilities:
  - Generate a random number
  - Accept user guesses and provide hints (higher/lower)
  - Count attempts and announce result  
  **Placeholder:** Replace this line with details about the range of numbers, maximum attempts (if any), and sample gameplay.

- `README.md`  
  This file.

## Features
- Small, focused programs that demonstrate:
  - Console I/O using `Scanner`
  - Basic control flow (`if`, `switch`, loops)
  - Simple error handling and input validation
  - Use of simple Java standard-library APIs (e.g., `Random`, `Math`)
- Easy to compile and run with the JDK
